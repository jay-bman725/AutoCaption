## [1.4.1] - 2025-06-06

### Fixed
- **Critical File Deletion Bug**: Fixed issue where original audio files under 25MB were being incorrectly deleted after transcription
  - Problem: Cleanup logic was unconditionally deleting the `processedPath` after transcription, but for files under 25MB, `processedPath` pointed to the original file instead of a temporary processed file

  - Impact: Original user files are now preserved when they don't require processing or compression
  - Debug logging now correctly indicates when no cleanup is needed vs. when temporary files are cleaned up

### Technical
- Modified transcription cleanup logic in `main.js` to check `wasCompressed` flag before file deletion
- Added proper logging to distinguish between temporary file cleanup and original file preservation
- Enhanced debug messaging to provide clearer feedback about file processing and cleanup operations
